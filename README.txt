Halloween Assets

For a homework assignment for my Unity class, we had the task to create a halloween themed scene using the certain tools we learned recently.

The requirements for the assinment are as follows: 

- Your project must have the Halloween ambiance
- You can create a Terrain with a size (width*Length) of 600*600 by Heightmap Sculpting or Sculpting tools
- You can use the Raise or Lower Terrain tool
- You can use the Smooth Height tool
- You can use the Paint Texture tools to create at least two different terrain layers with proper textures, normal maps, and tiling settings
- You can create at least two trees and paint them on the terrain. (For the rest decoration trees, you can get them from the online store
- You can paint grasses on the terrain
- You can create a simple lake with colors

At the same time of the assignment, a new season of a show I like called The Owl House came out, and I got an idea for the assignment.

I made a culdesac with a bunch of houses along the road. I made the scene nighttime and added streetlights, pumpkins, and jack-0-lanterns for the Halloween ambiance.
I surrounded the culdesac in trees and had a lake scene based on a scene from The Owl House hidden in the forest along a dirt path.

To open the completed assignment, download all the files in the Unity Project folder and put them into the projects folder in your Unity folder.
